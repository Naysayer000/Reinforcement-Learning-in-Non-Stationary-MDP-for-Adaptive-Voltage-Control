# Reinforcement-Learning-in-Non-Stationary-MDP-for-Adaptive-Voltage-Control

This project implements a Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) algorithm for voltage control in an IEEE 33-bus power distribution system. The goal is to maintain voltage stability under dynamic load and photovoltaic (PV) generation fluctuations using distributed reinforcement learning agents.
